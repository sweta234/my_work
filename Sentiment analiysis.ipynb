But whether this will actually occur, is currently extremely questionable, because presently, in a totalitarian manner, everything is directed towards interests which are economic, military, political and cultural – as well as towards that which is strict fundamentalist religious-sectarian – and based on enormous lies and devious, misanthropic, criminal and felonious machinations in every imaginable regard. This also means that the population of the USA is spied upon by the secret services and even severely within the neighbourhoods, and so forth, and, in every possible manner being restricted in its freedom, and this is in addition to the violence, as it emerges in some form or other, both openly and covertly.\\ufeff',\n",

This doesn't seem extreme until you realize that 39%(blacks) consists of that 14.1%, whith that 38%(whites) making up 63% of the US.

The governments own statistics reveal that children born into fatherless homes are more likely to drop out of school, more likely to have a history of unemployment, high chance of poverty, \\xa0and more likely to serve time in prison - the list goes on and on.\\n\\nWhen we look at the fact that 70% of black children will grow up in a fatherless home compared to 24% of \\xa0white children we see a number that begins to explain WHY black poverty and black crime is so high amongst blacks in America with 70% of black mothers on welfare.\\n\\nComplied with a dysfunctional gangster-rap culture that glorifies promiscuity, drug dealers the abuse of women and the power of the gun, we see a problem beginning to emerge and the reason for the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown begin to come clear.\\n\\nBlack Americans, a 13% minority, are doing 54% of the dying and probably 54% of the killing. That needs to be said. So now we have black culture of violence financed by the welfare system.\\xa0\\n\\n*CONCLUSION*\\n\\n*Like i said - there WILL BE \\xa0another \"race based case\" sooner or latter - in fact it will NEVER end.

For the most part, even the 7% of black murders by non-blacks are not directed at innocent black citizens, but rather drug or gang related. Donald Trump, Star Parker, I hope you are aware of Peggy Hubbard's comments and address this issue as honestly as she has. There needs to be a seat at the table for Ms. Hubbard in the Trump campaign and administration.\\n\\nRace Mongers like Obama, Eric Holder, Pelosi, Reid, Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Democrats (of all ethnicities, and on all levels of government), and the mainstream media have all conspired over the last 50 years to turn viable black communities into government-dependent ghettos by knowingly advancing a false narrative of systemic White (conservative) racism.\\n\\xa0\\nPerhaps their greatest accomplishment is the destruction of the black nuclear family. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to single mothers. \\xa0Why get married or limit the number of children you have, when Obama and the progressives will gladly extort taxpayer money to take care of you and your illegitimate children in exchange for guaranteed votes to keep themselves in power. \\xa0This master plan and policy insures generations of newly created disaffected and dysfunctional adults who will necessarily become democratic voters.\\n\\nIf the race hustlers mentioned above, reacted in the same way to black on black killings, they could go into those neighborhoods and with their power, wipe out all the gangs, minimize the drug use and give the community some real “hope” and “change.” \\xa0It will never happen. \\xa0They need black communities to be dependent and feel hopeless in order to maintain their power and control. \\xa0They are living the good life off the backs of their own people, while deceiving them into thinking they care. \\xa0Just think – if these purveyors of lies and damn lies couldn't make race an issue over the past 40 years they would have to get “real” jobs like the rest of us.\",\n",
